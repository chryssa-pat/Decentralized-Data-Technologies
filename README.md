This project involves the implementation of a real-time bike-sharing analytics system using decentralized data technologies. It integrates live data from bike-sharing systems and weather APIs, processes it using **Apache Kafka** for streaming and **Apache Spark** for distributed processing and builds a **machine learning model** to predict bike utilization. The system performs tasks such as data ingestion, real-time analysis, utilization rate calculations, and next-hour predictions while adhering to scalable and efficient software engineering practices.

## Data Creation
1. **Data Sources**:
   - **Bike-Sharing Data** (via GBFS API):
     - Station Information: Static data such as station names, locations, and capacities.
     - Station Status: Real-time data on bike availability and dock usage.
   - **Weather Data** (via OpenWeatherMap API):
     - Parameters: Temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloudiness.
   - Data is collected at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

2. **Features Generated**:
   - **Time-Based Features**: `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, and `is_weekend`.
   - **Weather Metrics**: Temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and cloudiness.
   - **Docking Station Metrics**: Average, max, min, and standard deviation of utilization rates.

## Goals
1. **Real-Time Analytics**:
   - Calculate utilization rates for docking stations and cities in real-time.
   - Correlate weather conditions with bike utilization.
2. **Machine Learning**:
   - Predict on-demand bike utilization for the next hour using a regression model.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Handle increasing data volumes efficiently with distributed computing frameworks.

## Programming Environment and Tools
1. **Programming Language**:
   - Python for API integration, data processing, and machine learning.
2. **Frameworks and Libraries**:
   - **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming and message queuing.
   - **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and machine learning pipelines (SparkML).
   - **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**: For exploratory data analysis and visualization.
3. **APIs**:
   - GBFS API for bike-sharing data.
   - OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
4. **Storage**:
   - Distributed database or storage solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL, HDFS).

## Pipeline
### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Fetch Live Data**:
  - Bike-sharing data (station information and status).
  - Weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and cloudiness).
- **Validation**:
  - Handle missing values, API rate limits, and errors.
  - Transform timestamps into usable features (`hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`).
- **Stream Data**:
  - Use Apache Kafka to stream data into separate topics for station info, station status, and weather.

### 2. Data Processing
- **Consume Data**:
  - Read data from Kafka topics into Apache Spark.
- **Analytics**:
  - Join bike-sharing and weather data.
  - Calculate utilization rates (average, max, min, standard deviation).
  - Correlate utilization with weather conditions.
  - Generate hourly usage summaries.
- **Storage**:
  - Save processed data into a distributed database.

### 3. Machine Learning
- **Training Data**:
  - Collect and store data over a specific period (e.g., 7 days).
- **Regression Model**:
  - Train a model using SparkML with features such as time and weather metrics.
  - Predict bike utilization for the next hour.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².

### 4. Visualization and Insights
- Create visualizations for:
  - Utilization patterns over time.
  - Weather correlations with bike usage.
  - Model performance metrics.

### 5. User Input and Prediction
- Accept user inputs for weather and time to predict next-hour utilization.
- Provide actionable insights for operational improvements.
